# Snookhead - React Native Restaurant App<<<<<<< HEAD

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

A restaurant management application with components for handling orders, billing, menu display, and queue management.

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Features

## Step 1: Start Metro

- Restaurant table management

- Order processing systemFirst, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

- Menu display with categories

- Bill generation and managementTo start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

- Queue system for customer management

- Navigation between different screens```sh

# Using npm

## Getting Startednpm start

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.# OR using Yarn

yarn start

## Step 1: Start Metro```

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.## Step 2: Build and run your app

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

````sh### Android

# Using npm

npm start```sh

# Using npm

# OR using Yarnnpm run android

yarn start

```# OR using Yarn

yarn android

## Step 2: Build and run your app```



With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:### iOS



### AndroidFor iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).



```shThe first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

# Using npm

npm run android```sh

bundle install

# OR using Yarn```

yarn android

```Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:



### iOS```sh

bundle exec pod install

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).```



The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).



```sh```sh

bundle install# Using npm

```npm run ios



Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:# OR using Yarn

yarn ios

```sh```

bundle exec pod install

```If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.



For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.



```sh## Step 3: Modify your app

# Using npm

npm run iosNow that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!



# OR using YarnOpen `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

yarn ios

```When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:



If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).

- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Congratulations! :tada:

## Step 3: Modify your app

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

### Now what?

Open `App.jsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).
